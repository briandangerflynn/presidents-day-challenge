      <h2>Rules:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>There are 44 drinks in the challenge. To complete the game, your team must collectively consume all 44 beverages.</li>
        <li>Each president has a favorite drink; however, as some drinks are difficult to find (e.g. madeira), alternative drinks are listed that you can use as substitutes.</li>
        <li>For sober presidents, you can either drink water or one of the alternative drinks listed.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Suggestions:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Pace Yourself.</b> This game is meant to be a fun way to enjoy a holiday, hangout with friends, and learn a little about history. It's <i><b>not</b></i> meant to be a launchpad into alcohol poisioning. <b>Please drink responsibly.</b></li>
        <li>See the chart below if you need some guidance on how much alcohol is unsafe.</li>
