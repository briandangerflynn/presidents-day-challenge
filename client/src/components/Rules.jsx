      <h2>Welcome!</h2>
      <p><b>What is it?:</b> The Presidents Day Challenge is a drinking game intended to be played in real life over President's Day Weekend with a team of friends.</p>
      <p><b>How does it work?:</b> We did some research and found the favorite alcoholic drinks of all 44 US presidents. Your team's goal is to drink every beverage on that list. This app will help your team mark which presidents' drinks you've consumed and which ones you still need to drink.</p>
      <h2>How To Play:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Create an account and either create a new team or join an existing one. <i>Note: When joining a team, team names are case sensitive.</i></li>
        <li>There are no limits on how big or small your team has to be; however, team size will affect how many drinks each individual will need to have, so choose responsibly. It's okay to add people to a team after the game has started.</li>
        <li>There are 44 drinks in the challenge. You can find all 44 drinks listed on the "Challenge" page, in the "Challengers" tab.</li>
        <li>To complete the game, your team must collectively consume all 44 beverages.</li>
        <li>When someone on your team has consumed a president's drink, click on the "drank" button next to that president to mark them as defeated.</li>
        <li>If you accidentally marked a president as defeated, you can go to the "Victories" tab and click the "Revive" button next to that president. This will put them back in the "Challengers" tab.</li>
        <li>Each president has a favorite drink; however, as some drinks are difficult to find (e.g. madeira), alternative drinks are listed that you can use as substitutes.</li>
        <li>For sober presidents, you can either drink water or one of the alternative drinks listed.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Suggestions:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Make it a themed event! Team uniforms or costumes can really make this a lot more fun.</li>
        <li>Get out of the house. Bar hopping can make this game even more fun and can help spread the joy!</li>
        <li>Don't be an asshole. That's just general life advice.</li>
        <li><b>Pace Yourself.</b> This game is meant to be a fun way to enjoy a holiday, hangout with friends, and learn a little about history. It's <i><b>not</b></i> meant to be a launchpad into alcohol poisioning. <b>Please drink responsibly.</b></li>
        <li>See the chart below if you need some guidance on how much alcohol is unsafe.</li>
